In the land of code, where bugs do roam,
A Rust developer calls it home.
With lifetimes checked and borrow rules tight,
They code through the day and into the night.

No null pointers to cause dismay,
Just safe concurrency all the way.
With `cargo build` and `cargo test`,
They strive to make their code the best.

Memory leaks? They laugh and scoff,
For Rust's ownership keeps them off.
Though the syntax might make others frown,
Rustaceans wear it like a crown.

So here's to the devs who code in Rust,
In safety and speed, they place their trust.
With fearless refactoring and zero-cost,
They've found the language they love the most.
